1.  **Review and refactor excessively long functions:**
    *   Identify functions exceeding a reasonable length (e.g., > 50 lines).
    *   Decompose these functions into smaller, more modular units, each performing a specific task.
    *   Ensure each new function has a clear purpose and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.
    *   Verify that the refactored code maintains the original functionality through rigorous testing.
2.  **Add comments to explain complex logic:**
    *   Pinpoint sections of code that are difficult to understand at first glance.
    *   Write concise and informative comments explaining the purpose, inputs, and outputs of these code sections.
    *   Clarify the algorithms and data structures used, providing context for future maintainers.
    *   Ensure that the comments are up-to-date and reflect any changes made to the code.
3.  **Standardize coding style for consistency:**
    *   Establish a coding style guide covering aspects such as indentation, naming conventions, and code formatting.
    *   Apply the style guide consistently throughout the codebase, using automated tools where possible.
    *   Ensure that all team members are familiar with the style guide and adhere to it in their contributions.
    *   Conduct code reviews to enforce the style guide and maintain consistency.
4.  **Implement unit tests for critical modules:**
    *   Identify the most critical modules and functions that require unit tests.
    *   Write comprehensive unit tests that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
    *   Use a testing framework to automate the execution of unit tests and track test results.
    *   Ensure that the unit tests are regularly updated to reflect any changes made to the code.
5.  **Remove any dead code or unused variables:**
    *   Identify and remove any code that is no longer used or reachable.
    *   Eliminate any variables that are declared but never used.
    *   Use automated tools to detect dead code and unused variables.
    *   Verify that the removal of dead code does not introduce any regressions.
6.  **Update documentation to reflect current functionality:**
    *   Review and update all documentation to reflect the current state of the codebase.
    *   Ensure that the documentation is accurate, complete, and easy to understand.
    *   Include examples of how to use the code and provide clear explanations of the functionality.
    *   Use a documentation generator to automate the process of creating and maintaining documentation.
